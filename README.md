**ClinicalLab**, a comprehensive clinical diagnosis agent alignment suite. ClinicalLab includes **ClinicalBench**, an end-to-end multi-departmental clinical diagnostic evaluation benchmark for evaluating medical agents and LLMs. ClinicalBench is based on real cases that cover 24 departments and 150 diseases. ClinicalLab also includes four novel metrics (**ClinicalMetrics**) for evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in clinical diagnostic tasks. **ClinicalAgent**, an end-to-end clinical agent that aligns with real-world clinical diagnostic practices. Our findings demonstrate the importance of aligning with modern medical practices in designing medical agents.
